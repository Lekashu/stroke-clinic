HEMORRHAGIC STROKE
<p>
 Hemorrhagic stroke is an emergency condition in which the raptured blood vessel causes bleeding inside the brain and it's a very dangerous condition and can easily cause death
 </p>
 <p>
 TYPES OF HEMORRHAGIC STROKE
 </P>
 <p>
 1: Intracerebral- this is bleeding within the brain and it's results from an injury. It is very dangerous and about 10% to 15% survived this type of hemorrhagic stroke
 </p>
 <p>
 2: subarachnoid hemorrhage - bleeding is in the subarachnoid space (space between the brain and the membrane that covers the brain).
 </p>
 CAUSES OF HEMORRHAGIC STROKE
  <p>
1: uncontrolled high blood pressure
</p
<p>
2: overtreatment with blood thinners
</p>
<p>
3:Bugles at weak spots in a blood vessel walls
</p>
<p>
4: Trauma example car accident
</p>
<p>
SYMPTOMS OF HEMORRHAGIC STROKE
</P>
<p>
1:sudden,server headache near the back of the head
</p>
<p>
2:lose of consciousness
</p>
<p>
4: confusion.
</p>
<p>
5: muscle pain in neck and shoulder.
</p>
<p>
6: nausea and vomiting.
</p>
<p>

       TREATMENT FOR HEMORRHAGIC STROKE
</p>
<p>
1:determining the cause of the bleeding.
</p>
<p>
2:controlling the blood pressure.
</p>
<p>
3:stopping any medication that can increase bleeding example asprin.
</p>

<p> 
              TEST
</p>
</p>

</p>
<p>
3: computerized tomography(ct)scan. ct scan uses a series of x-rays to cr 66eate a detailed image.
</p>
<p>
4: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).an mri uses powerful radio waves and magnetic field to create a detailed view of the brain. note mri is the best test for hemorrhagic stroke.
</p>
<p>
                SURGERY
</p>
<p>
SURGERY- is necessary if the area of bleeding is large, your doctor may perform surgery to remove the blood and relieve pressure in the brain.
